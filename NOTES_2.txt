#! What are RESTful APIs 
* API stands for Application Programming Interface.
* API is a set of instructions that a server uses to understand and respond to a request. * It is dynamic in nature and can be used to interact with any web service.
* Different endpoints in an API results in different actions.
* It is a standard that defines how a server should respond to a request.

* RESTful API means Representational State Transfer (REST).
* RESTful APIs has many benifits like they are fast, secure, scalability, maintainability, easy to understand and easy to change.

** Main 3 things in RESTful API are --> resources, representations and HTTP methods.

#! Resources
A resource in an API is just like a application in our project like "Products", "Collections", "Tags", "Carts", "Orders", "Customers".
* Resources are just collection of data.
* Resources are identified by their URLs (Uniform Resource Locator).

#! Resource Representations
* A resource representation is a representation of a resource in a particular format.
* A resource representation is identified by its pattern.

#! HTTP Methods
* HTTP methods are a set of verbs that a server can use to perform various actions on a resource.
* HTTP methods are identified by their name.
* HTTP methods --> GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD
