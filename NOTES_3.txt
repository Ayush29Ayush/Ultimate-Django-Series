#! Setting Up the Project and Database
1. Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database named storefront3.
2. Run "python manage.py makemigrations" and "python manage.py migrate" to create the tables in the database.
3. Now rather than using the seed.sql directly to import the data in the database using the SQL Workbench, we will use a custom command.
4. Create a custom command named "seed_db" my creating a management folder followed by a commands folder inside the store app. 
5. Write the following code in seed_db.py and place seed.sql file in the same directory.
"
#! CUSTOM COMMAND TO POPULATE THE DATABASE
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.db import connection
from pathlib import Path
import os


class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Populates the database with collections and products'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        print('Populating the database...')
        current_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)
        file_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'seed.sql')
        sql = Path(file_path).read_text()

        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(sql)

"
6. Now in the terminal, just type "python manage.py", we will see this output::
